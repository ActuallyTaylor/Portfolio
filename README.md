Hello and welcome to my personal blog!

## Details
This site is written using SvelteKit, and hosted on Netlify. It includes a custom blogging engine that allows me to simply drop a markdown file and the associated images into asset folders to load a new blog post. It also includes an image gallery for my photography and some other fun things!

## Why is this public?
I think showing off a site written completely in SvelteKit is important, when I was starting work on this site there were not a ton of resources to pull from. This site is fairly plain and does not have anything that can't be public or isn't publicly accessible, so why not open source it?
