    <h2>WWDC Wallet Passes</h2>
    <p>
        Every WWDC I like to make Wallet Passes for everyone attending virtually!
        They are a fun way to remember your time at WWDC without having to attend.
        There are currently three passses going back to 2021. The passes are themed
        after the invitations each year 😊

    <h2>Some Cool Things</h2>
    <h3>My cat Simon 🐈‍⬛</h3>
    <p>
        Simon is my cat! He is the most opinionated cat ever. He needs to eat at the exact same time every day. He has recently learned that he can give someone two quick taps on their shoulders to get their attention.

    <h3>My old Macintosh Plus 🍎</h3>
    <p>
        This is my old Macintosh Plus! It is one of my favorite pieces of retro tech that I own. It is actually a a Macintosh 512k with an upgraded motherboard from a Macintosh Plus. I have the boot up disks and a couple of utility disks for it. However, I want to get disks for IDEs so I can write some code for the old thing.
