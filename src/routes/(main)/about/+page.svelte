    <h2>Some Cool Things</h2>
    <h3>My two cats 🐈‍⬛</h3>
    <h3>Cinnamon</h3>
    <p>
        Cinnamon is a new addition to my life, she is incredibly cute but such a
        weird cat. She loves to climb and roll around in her tunnel.

    <h3>Simon</h3>
    <p>
        Simon is one of my cats! He is the most opinionated cat ever. He needs
        to eat at the exact same time every day. He has recently learned that he
        can give someone two quick taps on their shoulders to get their
        attention.

    <h3>My old Macintosh Plus 🍎</h3>
    <p>
        This is my old Macintosh Plus! It is one of my favorite pieces of retro
        tech that I own. It is actually a a Macintosh 512k with an upgraded
        motherboard from a Macintosh Plus. I have the boot up disks and a couple
        of utility disks for it. However, I want to get disks for IDEs so I can
        write some code for the old thing.
