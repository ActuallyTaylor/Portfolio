            Firefly is a pure swift Syntax highlighter for iOS. It was created to be a fast and native solution to a problem that did not have many good solutions.
            The project is open sourced so that anyone can help improve it and make it the best syntax highlighter for iOS.

            When I started working on Jellycuts, there was no good solution for an iOS based syntax highlighter.
            There were solutions that existed, such as <a href="https://github.com/twostraws/Sourceful">Sourceful</a> by Paul Hudson and <a href="https://github.com/raspu/Highlightr">Highlightr</a>.
            Both of these had drawbacks when it came to loading large files and adding custom languages. Because of this, I took the opportunity to create a modern syntax highlighter for both SwiftUI and UIKit.
