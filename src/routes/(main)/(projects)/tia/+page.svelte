            Terran Integration Application (or T.I.A. for short) is my winning 2021 submission to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/swift-student-challenge/">Apple's Swift Student Challenge</a>.

            T.I.A is an application that allows the user to create a genetic simulation. The user can create different species with different sets of genes.
            These species will then live together in a randomly generated environment. Based on the species genes, the genetic algorithm backing the application will
            simulate the species evolving and changing to better fit their environments.

            <br>
            <br>

            On top of the genetic algorithm, TIA also has a small storyline built into the application. The storyline puts you in the place of a person who has been discovered an other worldly being.
            This being has put you down in front of a genetic simulation to see how you would perform as a species ruling over an environment. The storyline can be discovered through interacting with
            the floating TIA ball.
