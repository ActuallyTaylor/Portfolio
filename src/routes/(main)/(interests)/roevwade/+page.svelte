            On June 27th 2022 me and my partner decided that we were going to travel into Washington DC to join the people protesting the overturning of Roe v. Wade. We made signs in preparation and then drove into DC for the day.
            We joined a group of people who were already protesting out front of the Supreme Court. We spent the day out in front of the Supreme Court with the rest of the protesters hearing others share their stories.
