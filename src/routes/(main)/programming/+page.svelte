<h1>ðŸ‘¾ Programming</h1>
<p>
    I work on a lot of different programming projects. A lot stem from personal
    projects but some also stem from clubs I do at school. My personal projects
    usually focus on Apple Centric development and my school projects focus on
    firmware and hardware!
</p>
<p>
    Currently I am working on a couple of projects.
    The biggest two are my apps Manny and Jellycuts.
    Jellycuts was just recently Open-Sourced and started off my path
    of writing more and more open source projects!
