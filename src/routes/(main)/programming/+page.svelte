<h1>ðŸ‘¾ Programming</h1>
<p>
    I work on a lot of different programming projects. A lot stem from personal
    projects but some also stem from clubs I do at school. My personal projects
    usually focus on Apple Centric development and my school projects focus on
    firmware and hardware!
</p>
<p>
    I am not currently working on any projects as I am finishing up a co-op at <a
        class="alwaysColoredLinkForATag"
        href="https://github.com/impel-intelligence">Impel Intelligence</a
    >. I plan on reviving a couple of my older projects very soon, so stay
    tuned! ðŸŽ‰

    <h2>What I am working on now</h2>
    <p>
        These projects are what I currently spend most of my time on. Most of
        the proejcts are Apple Platform based projects, many being iOS Apps or
        Swift Packages.
    </p>
