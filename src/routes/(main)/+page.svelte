    <h2>👋 Hey!</h2>
    <p>
        I am Taylor Lineman, programmer, weekly writer, photographer and a student!
        You may know me as <i>ActuallyTaylor</i> on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@TaylorLineman">Mastodon</a>,  <a href="https://github.com/ActuallyTaylor">GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLineman">Twitter</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I am studying Software Engineering at <a href="https://www.rit.edu/">Rochester Institute of Technology 🐅</a>.
        You can find me mostly working on my iOS Apps and Open Source projects, however recently
        I have ventured into Firmware development and started to love the challenge that comes with it.

        <h2>📝️ Writing</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
        Every week I Wednesday I write a blog post called Wonderful Web! This blog post
        highlights a set of new websites each week. These sites can be anything, but are
        usually tech related.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides writing Wonderful Web, I also write small posts about my Apps and workflows. These
        are more spontanoues so there is not defined schedule for them.

        <h2>👾 Programming</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
        I work on a lot of different programming projects. A lot stem from personal
        projects but some also stem from clubs I do at school. My personal projects
        usually focus on Apple Centric development and my school projects focus on
        firmware and hardware!
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently I am working on a couple of projects.
        The biggest two are my apps Manny and Jellycuts.
        Jellycuts was just recently Open-Sourced and started off my path
        of writing more and more open source projects!
