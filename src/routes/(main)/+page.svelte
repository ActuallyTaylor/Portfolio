    <h2>👋 Hey!</h2>
    <p>
        I am Taylor Lineman, programmer, photographer and a student! I am <i

        Currently, I am studying Software Engineering at <a
            href="https://www.rit.edu/">Rochester Institute of Technology 🐅</a
        >. You can find me mostly working on my iOS Apps and Open Source
        projects, however recently I have ventured into Firmware development and
        started to love the challenge that comes with it.

        <h2>📝️ Writing</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
        Sometimes on Wednesday I write a blog post called Wonderful Web! This
        blog post highlights a set of websites that I found really cool. These
        sites can be anything, but are usually tech related.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides writing Wonderful Web, I also write small posts about my Apps
        and workflows. These are more spontanoues so there is not defined
        schedule for them.

        <h2>👾 Programming</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
        I work on a lot of different programming projects. A lot stem from
        personal projects but some also stem from clubs I do at school. My
        personal projects usually focus on Apple Centric development and my
        school projects focus on firmware and hardware!
    </p>
    <p>
        I am not currently working on any projects as I am finishing up a co-op
        at <a
            class="alwaysColoredLinkForATag"
            href="https://github.com/impel-intelligence">Impel Intelligence</a
        >. I plan on reviving a couple of my older projects very soon, so stay
        tuned! 🎉

    <p>
        In my freetime you can usually find me with a camera in my hands. I love
        to shoot digital photos but my heart trully lies with film. I recently
        acquired some old film cameras and I am working on repairing them and
        filling up a roll of film!
