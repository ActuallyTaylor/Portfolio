As I venture throughout the internet, I collect a folder of websites / posts that really interest me. These are sites that I revisit every so often. I find these posts or websites to be some of the most interesting collections of work that anyone can read. The folder that I have on my computer is called Beautiful Web, and I think that works perfectly as the name for this series!

I hope you all enjoy reading as much as I like finding these sites!

## [Forth](https://ratfactor.com/forth/forth_talk_2023.html) - Dave Gauer
This is an absolutely amazing talk that [Dave Gauer](http://ratfactor.com/) gave about the Forth programming language. Forth is a programming language created by [Chuck Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Moore), a mad wizard of programming. This talk is an adventure through what makes Forth a special language and it also highlights a lot of different (admittedly complicated for me to understand) parts of computing. If you are interested in esoteric programming languages I highly recommend reading Dave's talk!

The talk is provided in two versions, you can either read the webpage or the slides version. The first time I saw this talk I stumbled upon the slides version. I really liked reading it in the slides format, I felt like I was following along with a story being told by Dave, that being sed if you are using a screen reader the webpage version is probably significantly better. Both contain the same content, so grab whichever you prefer (I recommend the slides)!

## [Making `JSON.parse()` fast](https://radex.io/react-native/json-parse/) - Radek Pietruszewski
This relatively short (compared to the Forth talk) post is packed with really interesting adventures into optimizing JavaScript's `JSON.parse()` function. The article goes into a lot of detail about how Radek optimized almost every part of `JSON.parse()` by using SIMD instructions for actually parsing the JSON along with converting from UTF-8 to UTF-16.

Even though Radek goes into a lot of detail about the individual optimizations and the low level functions he used, the post continues to be very readable. You can see where Radek's ideas start from and where the optimizations are coming from. I really enjoyed how Radek presented his whole process through a series of steps and 

This is a super good read especially if you are interested in the low level implementations of functions we work with every day.
