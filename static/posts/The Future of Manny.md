### Some Remarks
Manny is one of my favorite projects that I have worked on, it has always been an interest of mine to make a social media app. The rise of Mastodon created the perfect environment for me to fulfill this! I am excited to keep developing Manny, and I hope to make it one of the most well polished and feature packed apps for Mastodon!

## What to look for in the near future
Below are all of the features that I see as absolutely necessary for Manny in the very near future. These features will be some of the first implemented in coming updates.

The status composer will support the following:
- [ ] Post videos
- [ ] Post Audio
- [x] Poll end dates
- [ ] Post Gifs
- [ ] Paste Support for videos, gifs, audio in statuses
- [x] Count URLs as 23 characters
- [ ] Don’t count user instance after @ in character count

## In the not too far future (After the above)

These items will appear after the above items are all implemented, although some of these features may appear alongside the above features if they are found to be easy enough to implement.
